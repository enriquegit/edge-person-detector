# Person-detector with Edge Computing and Deep Learning.

This is a prototype of a person detector using deep learning and the Google Coral Edge usb accelerator running on a Raspberry Pi and the [Sense HAT](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/?resellerType=home). A pre-trained deep learning model is used to detect the number of persons from the camera and the person count is shown in the led display. It can also be optionally sent to a server with MQTT.

This demo shows how to use [TensorFlowLite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) to implement a real-time person detector running on an Edge device. A pre-trained [mobilenet_ssd_v2_coco_quant_postprocess_edgetpu](https://github.com/google-coral/edgetpu/raw/master/test_data/) deep learning model was used for the detection part. The model is quantized and optimized to run in the Google Coral accelerator.

## Hardware

- Google Coral USB accelerator [link](https://coral.ai/products/accelerator)
- Sense HAT [link](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/?resellerType=home)
- Raspberry Pi [link](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
- Camera Module v2 [link](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/?resellerType=home)


## Software

- The script were coded in Python
- The deep learning model is the [mobilenet_ssd_v2_coco_quant_postprocess_edgetpu](https://github.com/google-coral/edgetpu/raw/master/test_data/)
- [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) was used to send the result to a server.

## Code

- **person_detector.py** Script that performs the person detection task.
- **person_server.py** This is the mqtt based server. It receives the result from the edge device and prints the result.
- **detector.py** Auxiliary function to perform the detection. This script was taken from [this](https://github.com/google-coral/tflite/tree/master/python/examples/detection) official tflite examples repository.
- **models/** This is where the quantized model should be copied along with the labels.
